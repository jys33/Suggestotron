### Goal

To teach you PHP we are going to use a "Real World"
example. You've decided to create a voting system for you and your
friends to play with. You've decided at a minimum, you'd like to
allow users to:

* view the topics sorted by number of votes
* vote on topics
* create, edit, and destroy topics

You've sketched up an initial screenshot of what you want it to look like:

### Meta-Goal

When you have completed today's goal of getting the basic
application online you should understand:

* Basic PHP syntax
* How to try your PHP code (Psy Shell)
* How to go from requirements to a new working web application
* How to get your application online
* The basic tools a web developer uses (source control, editor, console, local server)

### Schedule

* 1-ish hour of introduction to the language 
* 5-ish hours of building your application

This is just a rough guideline, not a mandate. Some steps you'll go
over and some you'll go under. It'll all work out by the end of the
day...

### Requirements

We're going to be working with:

* PHP
* MySQL Database Server
* Terminal
* Bootstrap 3
* Sublime Text Editor
* Psysh
* Vagrant & VirtualBox
* Ubuntu Linux

We will provide you with everything you need to get started on the day.

### Working Effectively and Efficiently

We highly recommend you do the following:

* Open your browser fresh or hide any windows you already have open.
  * Bring up one window with two tabs
    * One for this content
    * One for interacting with your app.
* Open your text editor and _do not ever close it_. We're not quitters.
* When we get to the Terminal, you'll want to keep that open too
* Hide all extra applications. Turn off twitter, IM, and all other distractions.

By minimizing the number of things you interact with, you reduce the
amount of time spent switching between them and the context lost as
you work through the lessons. Having 50 tabs open in your web
browser gets confusing and wastes time.

### Format

Each lesson will look like this:

<div style="background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding-left: 4em;">
  <h1 class="doc_title" style="margin-top: 0em;">Step Title</h1>
  <div class="goals">
    <h1>Goal:</h1>
    <p>Description of the current step.
    <p>Red because big goals are scary
  </div>
  <div class="steps">
    <h1>Steps:</h1>
    <div class="step">
      <h1>
        <img src="img/fake_checkbox.png">&nbsp;<span class="prefix">Step 1</span>
      </h1>
      <div>
        <pre>Commands to run, or code to write</pre>
      </div>
      <p>Yellow because we've gotten it done, but we have no clue what's going on.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="explanation">
    <h1>Explanation</h1>
    <p>Details of what the steps actually did... spell out the cause and effect.
    <p>Green because we can tie everything together now.
  </div>
</div>
