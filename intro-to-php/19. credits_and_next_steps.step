Now that you've finished the Suggestotron curriculum, what next?

# Extra Credit

If you got all the way through Suggestotron with some time to spare, here's some extra stuff you can try:

* Add [appropriate icons](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons) to the Edit and Delete buttons
* Add a downvote button that does the opposite of what the upvote button does
* Add an 'about' page, linked from the bottom of the Suggestotron topics list. Link back to the Topics list from the About page so users don't get stranded.
* Add success messages when adding/editing topics
* Add error messages when adding/editing/deleting topics
* Make it so that all error messages are shown in the templates (e.g. going to the edit page without an ID)

## Lovingly Based on RailsBridge

Thanks to the amazing work of the volunteers behind [RailsBridge](http://railsbridge.org) and their
decision to release all of their content under a Creative Common (CC-BY) license, we are able to create
PHPBridge by standing on their shoulders and building up.

# What next?

- It's probably time for the closing presentation.
- After that, start a project, tutorial, and come back again!
- All our favorite resources can be found on the PHPBridge site: <http://phpbridge.org/learn/resources>
